            <h1>03.03.01 Prototype</h1>
            <h3>Focus?</h3>
            <p>The task was to build an interactive, <mark>hi-fidelity</mark> XD prototype (using a UI kit) of a website which was supposed to help international students to find their way around Copenhagen. It was meant to be clear that the sender was <mark>the Ministry of Higher Education and Science</mark> by using their logo, name and the appropriate tone of voice. The design of the website, however, should have followed the conventions of the job portal, real estate and dating sites. The main purpose of this assignment was to come up with a solution which would provide an optimal user experience.</p>

            <h3>My role?</h3>
            <p>First of all, I took part in the desk research regarding the conventions in content, design and functionality and in creating a style tile. I also wrote the majority of copy and microcopy and argued in our documentation why they provide a good UX for our target audience. Moreover, I participated in this assignment as a main creator of the final prototype in Adobe XD and I documented (using screenshots) its transition from low-fidelity to hi-fidelity. As a creator of 5 second test I also gathered and communicated the results and the future improvements which could be made based on these results.</p>

            <h3>New knowledge, perhaps?</h3>
            <p>Since it was kind of first group work, I’ve learnt that it can be quite difficult to get people with different opinions and personalities to agree on something or to find a common way of doing things. I understood that it would have saved us plenty of time if we had assigned someone in the group the role of Decider. I also found out more about how the right copy and microcopy can create a satisfying UX.</p>

                <figcaption>5 second test - <mark>*click on the image to try for yourself*</mark></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Furthermore, I’ve improved my Adobe XD skills and discovered that UI kits exist and make life easier. I also got familiar with a few usability test methods – <mark>Think Aloud test</mark> and <mark>5 second test</mark> – and came to the realization that there are always features which could be improved, no matter how perfect you think your product is, you just have to look at it through the eyes of user...and <mark>keep it simple, stupid!</mark>
            </p>
            <h3>Observations?</h3>
            <p>I also found out that there is plenty of knowledge I’ve attained in the past assignments which is applicable in this one as well – Adobe XD skills, desk research, content production, style tile, wireflow...</p>
