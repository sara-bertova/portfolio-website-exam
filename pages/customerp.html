            <h1>05.02.04 Customer pitch</h1>
            <h3>Focus?</h3>
            <p>The focus of this assignment was to prepare a short, precise pitch which would show our concept in the best light and convince the customer (Foodsharing Copenhagen) that it is worth implementing.</p>
            <h3>My role?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, I could not make it to the actual pitch (my flight home was scheduled for that day) but I was part of the preparation process. I participated in <mark>the golden circle</mark> exercise in which I tried to work out with the rest of my team members our <mark>“why?” (motivation), “how?” (process)</mark> and <mark>“what?” (solution)</mark> – it was especially difficult to understand what “why?” actually means and we just kept coming up with more “hows”.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, I went to present our golden circle to the two of our classmates and based on their feedback we managed to shape our ideas more. In the <mark>pilot pitch</mark>, my task was to prepare and give a short talk concerning our “how” and a short description of one of the sections on our campaign website. This became a foundation for the part of the real pitch.</p>
            <p>After our presentation was done we received yet another <mark>valuable feedback</mark> from the feedback group and the teachers. Their opinions and insights helped us realize what can be improved until the actual pitch regarding not only our project but the way of selling it as well.</p>
            <h3>New knowledge, perhaps?</h3>
            <p>Thanks to this assignment I’ve got a better understanding of what a pitch actually is. I found it to be a good practice of clear communication, testing how well we understand our idea as well as receiving relevant feedback. This way we learn to argue for our content and design choices.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I came to the realization that your <mark>body language</mark> and how loud and clear you speak is at least equally important as the words you speak. In addition, I discovered that to know your “why?” is the key to success and that a lot can be done in only 30 minutes.</p>
