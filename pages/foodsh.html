            <h1>05.02.01 Foodsharing Copenhagen</h1>

            <h3>Focus?</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this group assignment was to create a campaign site and video to promote <mark>Foodsharing Copenhagen</mark> and to get people to volunteer in this organisation or to educate people on how to <mark>reduce food waste</mark>. Our group decided to go with the topic of <mark>raising awareness</mark> regarding this issue providing users with interesting facts and tips on how to fight it. The goal was to engage the users enough for them to get the message.</p>

            <h3>My role?</h3>
            <p>I took part in the decision process regarding the layout and styling of our website and the story for our campaign video. I also did desk research about the competition – <mark>Wefood, Grim</mark> and <mark>Too Good To Go</mark>. Besides that, I went to the Foodsharing event to get a better understanding of the idea and to conduct short interviews with a few participants and a volunteer – the quotes from these we later used for our website.</p>

            <p>Moreover, I wrote part of the copy (tips on how to reduce food waste, best before vs. use by date, one of the slogans) and chose the majority of images we used on our website. Regarding the video, I provided my team with a filming location (except Nørreport) and played one of the characters (the cheese scene).</p>

                <p>Since I have already experienced working in a group in the previous assignments I felt like this cooperation went quite smooth. I struggled less to express my opinion or point out features which I thought were problematic. Besides, I’ve learnt also something about myself – according to the short online test I took I discovered that I am a <mark>conceptualizer</mark> – it helped me to understand my strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                <p>Moreover, I’ve got a better understanding of how to plan, shoot and edit a video. I realized how crucial are the first seconds of a video in order to draw user’s attention. And most importantly I got an idea of how it is like to develop a product for a real customer.</p>
