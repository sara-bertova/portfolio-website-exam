            <h1>04.03.01 Project pool 1</h1>
            <h3>Focus?</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this assignment was to evaluate our HTML, CSS and Javascript skills and pick a project from the selection we were provided with according to that. With a randomly assigned partner, we were supposed to analyse each project carefully and decide on which one we want to work on. Afterwards, we were to use all the relevant knowledge in order to find a solution to the chosen problem in one day.</p>
            <p>The project we picked was <mark>Guess the number</mark> – a game in which a computer generates a random number for the user to guess. The program should have also communicated with the user by saying whether their guess was too low/high or correct (our version also informs the user how many guesses they’ve used).</p>

            <h3>My role?</h3>
            <p>I participated in the decision process by breaking each problem into smaller pieces. I also volunteered to do the coding part of the project since I perceived it as a challenge which could have helped me to develop these skills.</p>
            <h3>New knowledge, perhaps?</h3>
            <p>I feel like this assignment helped me to more understand and deepen my knowledge regarding Javascript. I also got to know <mark>GitHub</mark> better and the way it works. Moreover, I’ve learnt that it can be very intimidating to work on something with basically a stranger when it has to be done in such a short span of time. In order to meet the deadline, you have to be cooperative and flexible.</p>
