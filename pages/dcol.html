            <h1>03.01.01 Data collection</h1>
            <h3>Focus?</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this assignment was to explore 4 research methods – <mark>desk, observation, interview and survey research</mark>. Afterwards, I was supposed to process the data I have collected and combine it into one documentation. Finally, I had to find a way how to present research and analysis insights in an easy and exciting way.</p>

            <h3>My role?</h3>
            <p>First of all, I did the desk research on the topic <mark>Lego used in the context of children's learning</mark>. I created several folders for different types of material I found (images, videos,...), and then in the document, I saved all the relevant links which I categorized according to what side of the topic they covered. </p>
            <p>For the observation I chose <mark>Queue culture</mark>, so I went to Føtex to spy on people standing in the line by the cash desks. I observed their behaviour and took notes and several pictures as well to document it all. I remember a lot of "why", "what" and "how" questions flooding my mind.</p>
            <p>The interview part of my research was probably the most enjoyable one. I was on Skype talking to my friend from home and <mark>The social media</mark> topic came very naturally. It actually turned into a deep long-lasting conversation in which my friend exposed her true feelings regarding Instagram and other social platforms. Since she allowed me to record the audio on my phone I did not have to distract myself with taking notes and could be fully concentrated on what she had to say. </p>
            <p>The last part of my research was an online survey I did with my classmate using Google forms about <mark>The accommodation of international students in Copenhagen</mark>.</p>

            <h3>New knowledge, perhaps?</h3>
            <p>Thanks to this assignment I became familiar with the theory, methods and tools which can be used for research. I got the chance to experience it for myself and gather information based on what I read, saw and heard rather than assume.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I had the opportunity to understand that to create a questionnaire using <mark>Google forms</mark> does not require much effort (even though your questions have to be carefully thought through), however, it can help you tremendously in your research. This assignment broadened my horizons in terms of what is actually behind the product development.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I’ve learnt that just to gather insights is not enough you also have to be able to categorize and communicate them in the right way. It was a daunting challenge which eventually turned into a precious new knowledge.</p>
