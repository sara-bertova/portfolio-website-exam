            <h1>02.04.01 Responsive website</h1>
            <h3>Focus?</h3>
            <p>The focus of this assignment was responsive web design. Our goal was to create a responsive version of the mobile website about our given style we worked on during the previous weeks. In order to reach that we had to optimise content, design and of course, code – include our logo and icons in SVG format and minimum of 2 breakpoints in CSS for various viewports. Moreover, we had to use the CSS grid and make sure our HTML and CSS are valid.</p>

            <h3>My role?</h3>
            <p>For this assignment, I started with copying my code for the mobile website about my given style <mark>(Swiss style)</mark> to avoid messing up the code which already worked. I did not make any significant changes to the content, only small alternations – I added scalable icons and logo created in Illustrator and exported in SVG format.</p>

            <p>In this theme we were introduced to the 5 multi-device layout patterns – <mark>mostly fluid, column drop, layout shifter, tiny tweaks</mark> and <mark>off-canvas</mark>. I decided to go with a <mark>mostly fluid</mark> layout pattern because it seemed to fit my website best. Afterwards, I started with implementing responsive layout – implementing grid and breakpoints for various screen sizes in CSS. On several pages (2 articles about Swiss style, design and about me) I rearranged the main part into 2 columns. As the last step, I validated my HTML and CSS and uploaded it on my domain via FileZilla.</p>

            <h3>New knowledge, perhaps?</h3>
            <p>I got introduced to the basic terminology concerning digital communication, user interface design or responsive web design. Moreover, I’ve gained basic skills working with <mark>Photoshop, Illustrator</mark> and <mark>XD</mark>. I’ve learnt how to code a website from scratch that works on more platforms from mobile to desktop using <mark>HTML</mark> and <mark>CSS</mark>. I also found out about the new usability testing method – <mark>Trunk test</mark>. Additionally, I came to the realization of how with the right folder structure can my work become more organized and less stressful. </p>
