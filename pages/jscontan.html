            <h1>04.02.01 Javascript controlled animation</h1>
            <h3>Focus?</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this assignment was to create a webpage on which the user could turn ten different CSS animations of our character (from the Sprite animation on the background assignment) on and off. It was supposed to be <mark>Javascript controlled</mark> and contain an animated SVG and at least one sound which would be helpful for the user. Moreover, we should have made it obvious for the user which animation they’ve turned on.</p>
            <h3>My role?</h3>
            <p>First of all, I created a webpage in the middle of which I placed my character from the previous assignment. Then I made 10 on/off buttons which I named after the <mark>10 different animations</mark> (rotate, translate, skew,...). After I coded the animations in CSS I used Javascript to make sure that a particular animation would turn on/off when clicking a particular button.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to help the user to understand which animation is running I made the button change its colour when clicked. Then I embedded audio (mouse clicking sound) in HTML and created a function in Javascript for turning it on and off whenever the user clicked the button. To make it even more obvious what on the page is clickable cursor changes to <mark>pointer</mark> and font colour to a different one when hovering your mouse over the buttons.</p>

                <figcaption>Javascript controlled animation page - <mark>*click on the image to see Andy's tricks*</mark></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As a final step, I wrote the name of my character (ANDY) in Illustrator, vectorised it, exported as SVG and copy/pasted the XML in my HTML file. I gave it some styling and made the <mark>„drawing“ animation</mark> in CSS (also controlled with Javascript).</p>

            <h3>New knowledge, perhaps?</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, I’ve gained the basic knowledge of Javascript – controlling events, functions, conditions, arrays,...which helped me to control media and animations. I’ve also learnt how to <mark>embed audio</mark> in a web page and how to create an animated SVG. Moreover, I was introduced to the GitHub and set up my own profile.</p>
